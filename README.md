# ðŸ§¬ Biological Age Estimation â€“ Machine Learning Project

This project aims to estimate **biological age** from medical and dermatological data using Machine Learning techniques. It includes full data preprocessing, visualization, regression, and classification tasks to analyze age-related features.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Contents

- `data.csv`: The raw dataset used in the project.
- `biological_age_estimation.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook with the full code.
- `report.pdf`: A detailed report explaining all steps and results.

## ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing

- Cleaning of missing or inconsistent values.
- Feature selection and transformation.
- Creation of a new **`age_range`** column for classification purposes.

## ðŸ“Š Data Visualization

Various plots and charts were generated to explore:
- Age distributions
- Correlations between features
- Differences between age ranges

## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Models

Applied both **regression** and **classification** algorithms, including:
- Linear Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation & Results

- Error margins and model performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, RÂ²) were visualized and compared.
- Classification accuracy was assessed across age ranges.
